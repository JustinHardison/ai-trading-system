❌ Would reject EV 0.31 (< 0.5 threshold)
❌ Would exit at -0.5% loss (premature)
```

### NEW SYSTEM (Current):
```
✅ Only takes score 55+ (top tier)
✅ Only takes 2/3+ alignment (majority)
✅ Scales EV 0.31 at 31% size (not reject)
✅ Ignores losses < 0.5% (let breathe)
```

**This trade proves ALL fixes are working!**
