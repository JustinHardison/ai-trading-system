## 📈 PROOF THE SYSTEM WORKS

### US100 Recovery Story:
```
1. Position opened (earlier)
2. Went to -$26.68 loss (-0.013%)
3. Exit logic: HOLD (loss too small, EV favors holding)

❌ Total loss: $26.68
```

**With new system (let it breathe):**
```
✅ Held through -0.013% loss
✅ Position recovered
✅ Now in profit $7.14
✅ Still holding for more
