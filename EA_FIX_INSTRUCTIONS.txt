EA FIX REQUIRED - CRITICAL ISSUE
=================================

THE PROBLEM:
The EA is blocking BUY/SELL actions when ANY position exists, even on DIFFERENT symbols.

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
1. API/AI approves: BUY GBPUSD @ 62.2%
2. API sends: action="BUY", lot_size=1.0
3. EA blocks it: "Already have position on GBPUSD.sim - skipping BUY"

WHY THIS IS WRONG:
- The EA should allow positions on DIFFERENT symbols
- The EA should execute SCALE_IN/DCA actions (which the API already sends correctly)
- The EA is making trading decisions instead of executing AI decisions

THE FIX IN AI_Trading_EA_Ultimate.mq5:
======================================

FIND THIS CODE (around line where it checks for existing positions):
```
if (PositionSelect(symbol)) {
    Print("Already have position on ", symbol, " - skipping ", action);
    return;
}
```

REPLACE WITH:
```
// Allow SCALE_IN and DCA actions even if position exists
if (action == "SCALE_IN" || action == "DCA") {
    Print("AI wants to ", action, " - executing");
    // Continue to OrderSend
}
// Only block if trying to open NEW position on SAME symbol
else if (action == "BUY" || action == "SELL") {
    if (PositionSelect(symbol)) {
        Print("Already have position on ", symbol, " - skipping duplicate ", action);
        return;
    }
}
```

OR BETTER YET - TRUST THE AI COMPLETELY:
```
// Remove the position check entirely
// The AI already handles this logic intelligently
// Just execute what the AI decides

if (action == "BUY") {
    OrderSend(...);
}
else if (action == "SELL") {
    OrderSend(...);
}
else if (action == "SCALE_IN" || action == "DCA") {
    OrderSend(...);  // Add to position
}
else if (action == "SCALE_OUT") {
    OrderClose(...);  // Reduce position
}
else if (action == "CLOSE") {
    OrderClose(...);  // Close entire position
}
```

WHY THE AI IS SMARTER:
======================
The API already:
- Checks for existing positions
- Decides when to SCALE_IN (add to winners)
- Decides when to DCA (average down on losers)
- Decides when to open new trades on different symbols
- Uses 115 features to make intelligent decisions

The EA should EXECUTE these decisions, not BLOCK them!

CURRENT IMPACT:
===============
- Missing SCALE_IN opportunities (can't compound winners)
- Missing DCA opportunities (can't average down)
- Missing new trades on different symbols (can't diversify)
- AI decisions being overridden by hard-coded EA logic

PRIORITY: CRITICAL
==================
This is preventing the AI-driven trading system from working as designed.
