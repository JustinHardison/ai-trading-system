## 📈 REAL MARKET SCORES OBSERVED

### Typical Scores (Real Data)
- **Entry Score**: 18-54/100
  - Trend: 0-100 (varies by alignment)
  - Momentum: 45-75 (RSI/MACD)
  - Volume: 0 (accumulation/distribution rare)
  - Structure: 40 (confluence common)
  - ML: 70-80 (confidence)

### Why Volume is 0
✅ **This is CORRECT** - Strong accumulation/distribution is RARE
✅ Most of the time market is neutral
✅ This is REAL DATA, not a bug
✅ System properly detects when it exists

### Why Scores are 40-55
✅ **This is NORMAL** for real market conditions
✅ Perfect trend (100) + decent momentum (45) + structure (40) = 47-55
✅ Thresholds adjusted to realistic levels (55 for entry, 50 for scale-in)
✅ System will trade when conditions align
