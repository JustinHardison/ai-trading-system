# 🎯 REALISTIC SWING TRADING TARGETS - $200K Account

**Date**: November 20, 2025, 9:12 PM  
**Reality Check**: Conservative, achievable goals

---

## THE REALITY:

### Your Current Results:
- **Win Rate**: 70.8% (17 wins, 7 losses)
- **Average Win**: $7.39
- **Average Loss**: $11.91
- **Problem**: Losses bigger than wins = losing money

### What's Actually Achievable:

**With proper swing trading (2% targets, -2% stops):**

```
$200,000 account
Risk per trade: 1% = $2,000
Target per trade: 2% = $4,000

Conservative (60% win rate):
- 10 trades: 6 wins × $4k = $24k, 4 losses × $2k = -$8k
- Net: $16,000 per 10 trades
- Monthly (30 trades): $48,000 profit (24% ROI)

Realistic (65% win rate):
- 10 trades: 6.5 wins × $4k = $26k, 3.5 losses × $2k = -$7k  
- Net: $19,000 per 10 trades
- Monthly (30 trades): $57,000 profit (28.5% ROI)

Good (70% win rate):
- 10 trades: 7 wins × $4k = $28k, 3 losses × $2k = -$6k
- Net: $22,000 per 10 trades
- Monthly (30 trades): $66,000 profit (33% ROI)
```

## REALISTIC MONTHLY TARGETS:

### Conservative (Safe):
- **Trades**: 20-30 per month (1 per day)
- **Win Rate**: 60%
- **Target**: $40,000-$50,000 monthly
- **ROI**: 20-25% per month

### Realistic (Achievable):
- **Trades**: 30-40 per month (1-2 per day)
- **Win Rate**: 65%
- **Target**: $50,000-$70,000 monthly
- **ROI**: 25-35% per month

## WHY PREVIOUS PROJECTIONS WERE WRONG:

### I Said: $108k-$222k per month
**Problem**: 
- Assumed 60 trades/month (2 per day)
- Assumed perfect execution
- Didn't account for:
  - Market conditions (some days no setups)
  - Slippage and commissions
  - Drawdown periods
  - Psychological factors

### Reality:
- Swing trades take 1-24 hours to develop
- Not every day has good setups
- Need to be selective (quality > quantity)
- 1-2 good trades per day is realistic
- 20-40 trades per month is achievable

---

## PROPER RISK MANAGEMENT:

### Per Trade:
- **Risk**: 1% of account = $2,000
- **Target**: 2% of account = $4,000
- **Risk:Reward**: 1:2
- **Stop**: -2% hard stop
- **Never risk more than 1% per trade**

### Daily:
- **Max Trades**: 2-3 per day
- **Max Risk**: 3% daily = $6,000
- **Target**: $8,000-$12,000 daily
- **If down $6k, stop trading for the day**

### Weekly:
- **Target**: $20,000-$30,000
- **Max Drawdown**: -$10,000 (5%)
- **If down 5%, reduce size or take break**

### Monthly:
- **Conservative**: $40,000-$50,000 (20-25% ROI)
- **Realistic**: $50,000-$70,000 (25-35% ROI)
- **Aggressive**: $70,000-$100,000 (35-50% ROI)
- **Max Drawdown**: -$20,000 (FTMO limit)

## THE MATH THAT WORKS:

### With 1% Risk, 2% Target, 65% Win Rate:

**Per 20 Trades**:
```
Wins: 13 × $4,000 = $52,000
Losses: 7 × $2,000 = -$14,000
Net: $38,000
```

**Per Month (30 trades)**:
```
Wins: 19.5 × $4,000 = $78,000
Losses: 10.5 × $2,000 = -$21,000
Net: $57,000 (28.5% ROI)
```

**Per Year**:
```
Monthly: $57,000
Yearly: $684,000
Starting: $200,000
Ending: $884,000
ROI: 342% per year
```

**This is realistic and sustainable.**
