## 🎯 WHEN WILL THEY CLOSE?

### AI Position Manager Logic:

The AI will close positions when:

1. **Profit Target Hit** (Take Profit)
   - Each position has a TP level
   - Automatic close when reached

2. **Stop Loss Hit**
   - Each position has SL protection
   - Automatic close to limit losses

3. **AI Decides to Exit** based on:
   - **Supporting factors drop** < 3/7 (currently all have 3-5/7)
   - **ML signal reverses** (BUY → SELL or vice versa)
   - **Profit deteriorates** significantly
   - **Market regime changes** (trending → ranging)
   - **Time-based exit** (if position too old with no progress)

### Current Stance:
**ALL positions on HOLD** - "Giving trade room to develop"

This means:
- ✅ Positions are still valid
- ✅ Market conditions support holding
- ✅ No immediate exit signals
- ✅ Waiting for TP or better exit opportunity
