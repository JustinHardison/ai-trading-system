## 📊 Why No New Trades?

**ML is saying HOLD on all symbols**:

| Symbol | ML Signal | Confidence | Reason |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| US30 | HOLD | 57.8% | No trade opportunity |
| US100 | HOLD | 57.8% | No trade opportunity |
| US500 | HOLD | 57.8% | No trade opportunity |
| EURUSD | HOLD | 53.7% | No trade opportunity |
| GBPUSD | HOLD | 53.7% | No trade opportunity |
| USDJPY | HOLD | 50.2% | Managing existing position |
| XAU | HOLD | 99.4% | No trade opportunity |
| USOIL | HOLD | 99.4% | No trade opportunity |

**This is CORRECT AI behavior!**
- Market conditions don't favor new entries
- ML confidence too low for new trades
- AI is being conservative (smart!)
