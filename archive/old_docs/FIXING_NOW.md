# 🔧 FIXING THE SYSTEM NOW

**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## What I'm Fixing:

1. ✅ Switched to Enhanced Feature Engineer (159 features)
2. ✅ Fixed method name: `engineer_all_features`
3. ⏳ Testing ML predictions now...

## Changes Made:

### API Changes:
- Changed from SimpleFeatureEngineer → FeatureEngineer
- Fixed method calls: engineer_features → engineer_all_features
- Simplified model prediction (DataFrame input)

### What Should Happen:
- ML predictions should work
- System should start executing trades
- Scale in/out should activate

## Testing in 40 seconds...
