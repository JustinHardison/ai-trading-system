## 🎯 Asset Class Thresholds

### **Forex** (More Liquid):
```
Base Threshold: 52%
Reasoning: Tighter spreads, more liquid, easier to trade
Examples: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY

Bypass Paths:
- Path 1: ML > 52% + quality setup
- Path 2: ML > 58% + R:R ≥ 2.0
- Path 3: ML > 60% + R:R ≥ 1.5
- Path 4: ML > 62% alone
```

### **Indices** (Medium Volatility):
```
Base Threshold: 58%
Reasoning: More volatile, wider spreads, need higher confidence
Examples: US30, US100, US500

Bypass Paths:
- Path 1: ML > 58% + quality setup
- Path 2: ML > 64% + R:R ≥ 2.0
- Path 3: ML > 66% + R:R ≥ 1.5
- Path 4: ML > 68% alone
```

### **Commodities** (Most Volatile):
```
Base Threshold: 60%
Reasoning: Most volatile, widest spreads, highest risk
Examples: XAU (Gold), USOIL (Oil)

Bypass Paths:
- Path 1: ML > 60% + quality setup
- Path 2: ML > 66% + R:R ≥ 2.0
- Path 3: ML > 68% + R:R ≥ 1.5
- Path 4: ML > 70% alone
```

## 📊 Quality Setup Requirements

### **All Asset Classes Need**:

1. Multi-timeframe bullish + at support, OR
2. Strong confluence + institutional flow, OR
3. H4 + H1 both at key levels, OR
4. Trend alignment + volume confirms, OR
5. Order book pressure confirms

PLUS:
- No severe volume divergence
- No multi-timeframe divergence
- Not in volatile regime without confluence
